This repository contains MD simulation input and data, in directories MDsim and Source_data.
The files in MDsim are for an unrestrained simulation started from the end of the refinement simulation, and include the simulaton input file, the initial structure (= last frame of the refinement simulation), and the final output of the simulation.
The excel file in Source_data contains data used to make plots in figures.
